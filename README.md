# Earthquake-Monitor

Earthquakes are becoming more and more frequent. It is useful to have an app that can read a feed of earthquake data and display it for the user.

The purpose of this app is to pull in data from a feed hosted by the USGS for earthquakes that have occurred within the last hour and updated every minute. The “summary” data will display in a list view with a native indicator that more details are available.

The user can tap the “summary” row and be taken to a detailed view of the data, which is obtained via a different URL endpoint.
